### Key Improvements:

1. **Threading**:
   - Each download runs in its own thread, allowing multiple files to be downloaded concurrently.
   - Threads are joined at the end to ensure all downloads complete before the script exits.

2. **Live Display**:
   - The `tqdm` library provides a live progress bar for each download, showing the progress in real time.

3. **Link Management**:
   - Added functionality to fetch and store MTGJSON links dynamically.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Improved error handling during downloads and file processing.

5. **Scalability**:
   - The script can handle large downloads efficiently with threading and progress tracking.
