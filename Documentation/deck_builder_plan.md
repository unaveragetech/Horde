# Plan for Enhancing the MTG Deck Builder

## Objective
Enhance the deck builder in `mtgdb_manager.py` to make it more detailed and user-friendly, with a focus on ensuring robust integration with Ollama for generating decks based on user input and selected cards.

---

## Key Enhancements

### 1. **User Interface Improvements**
- **Card Selection Panel**:
  - Add a panel where users can browse and select cards from the database.
  - Allow users to add selected cards to the deck with adjustable quantities.
- **Real-Time Deck Preview**:
  - Display the deck being built, categorized by card type (Creatures, Spells, Lands).
  - Enable users to remove cards or adjust quantities directly in the preview.
- **Enhanced Search**:
  - Improve the card search functionality with filters (e.g., by type, rarity, set).

---

### 2. **Ollama Integration**
- **Enhanced Prompting**:
  - Include user-selected cards and constraints (e.g., card types, quantities) in the prompt sent to Ollama.
  - Provide detailed instructions to Ollama for generating decks that adhere to Magic: The Gathering rules.
- **Result Display**:
  - Show Ollama's deck suggestions alongside the user's customizations.
  - Allow users to merge or override Ollama's suggestions.
- **Error Handling**:
  - Handle API errors gracefully and provide meaningful feedback to the user.

---

### 3. **Validation and Feedback**
- **Database Validation**:
  - Verify that all cards in the generated deck exist in the database.
  - Highlight missing cards and suggest alternatives.
- **Deck Constraints**:
  - Ensure the deck adheres to Magic: The Gathering rules (e.g., 60 cards, balanced mana base).
  - Provide warnings for any issues, such as exceeding card limits.

---

### 4. **Code Refactoring**
- **Modularization**:
  - Separate UI components, database interactions, and AI integration into distinct modules or classes.
- **MVC Pattern**:
  - Use a Model-View-Controller pattern to improve code organization and maintainability.

---

### 5. **Additional Features**
- **Save and Load Decks**:
  - Add functionality to save decks as templates and reload them for future use.
- **Progress Indicators**:
  - Include a progress bar or spinner for long-running operations like deck generation.
- **Tooltips and Help**:
  - Provide tooltips and help messages to guide users through the deck-building process.

---

## Implementation Steps

1. **Refactor Existing Code**:
   - Modularize the current deck builder code.
   - Separate Ollama integration into a dedicated function or class.

2. **Enhance the User Interface**:
   - Add a card selection panel and real-time deck preview.
   - Improve search functionality with filters.

3. **Integrate Ollama**:
   - Update the prompt generation logic to include user-selected cards and constraints.
   - Handle API responses and display results effectively.

4. **Add Validation and Feedback**:
   - Implement database validation for generated decks.
   - Add checks for deck constraints and provide feedback.

5. **Test and Debug**:
   - Test the enhanced deck builder with various inputs and scenarios.
   - Debug any issues and ensure a smooth user experience.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional and user-friendly deck builder with robust Ollama integration.
- Modular and maintainable codebase following best practices.
- Documentation for new features and usage instructions.
